## Usage

1. Download UABE from [here](https://7daystodie.com/forums/showthread.php?22675-Unity-Assets-Bundle-Extractor)
2. Run AssetBundleExtractor.exe (Note: this is a windows only tool).
3. File -> Open -> Select "Path\to\Gwent\GWENT_Data\StreamingAssets/AssetBundles/data_definitions". You will prompted to unpack the file, do that. Then click info.
4. Find the GwentCardTemplates asset (note there is more than one, always get the largest*)
5. Click export raw and save that file as 'GwentCardTemplates.dat'.
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for the following assets: "GwentCardAbilities", "GwentTooltips", "cards_en-US" "tooltips_en-US". Save them all in the same directory.
7. Run file_setup.sh passing in the directory that contains the .dat files.
    e.g ./file_setup.sh --inputs path/to/folder/with/.dat/files/
8. Run process_xml.py, passing in the outputs folder from step 8.
    e.g. ./process_xml.py ../outputs/




* The difference between the files may be the different patches, Geralt Aard is present in the largest file, but not the smallest for example.
