## Usage

1. Download UABE from [here](https://7daystodie.com/forums/showthread.php?22675-Unity-Assets-Bundle-Extractor)
2. Run AssetBundleExtractor.exe (Note: this is a windows only tool).
3. File -> Open -> Select "Path\to\Gwent\GWENT_Data\resources.assets"
4. Find the GwentCardTemplates asset (note there is more than one, always get the largest*)
5. Click export raw and save that file somewhere. It will save as a .dat file.
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for the following assets: "GwentCardAbilities", "GwentTooltips", "cards_en-US" "tooltips_en-US"
7. Run file_setup.sh passing each .dat file as a parameter.
    e.g ./file_setup.sh --templates ../GwentCardTemplates.dat --abilities ../GwentCardAbilities.dat --tooltips ../GwentTooltips.dat 
        --tooltip-strings ../tooltips_en-US.dat --card-names ../cards_en-US.dat
8. Run process_xml.py, passing in the outputs folder




* The difference between the files may be the different patches, Geralt Aard is present in the largest file, but not the smallest for example.
